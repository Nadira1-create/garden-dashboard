##  Key Sections

### **Weather Overview**
Current environmental conditions with temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and weather conditions.

### **Plant Status Cards**
Individual monitoring for each plant showing:
- Current soil moisture levels
- Optimal moisture ranges
- Color-coded health status
- Watering schedules

### **Data Visualization Charts**
- **Soil Moisture Trends**: 24-hour line chart
- **Temperature & Humidity**: Dual-line comparison
- **Light Levels**: Bar chart showing lux readings
- **Garden Health**: Pie chart summary

### **AI-Powered Recommendations**
Smart growing tips including watering alerts, light optimization, and growth predictions.

##  Data Architecture

```
Mock IoT Sensors â†’ Data Generation â†’ React State Management â†’ Chart Visualization â†’ User Interface
```

Currently uses simulated data that mimics real sensor readings:
- **Soil Moisture**: 30-70% range with realistic fluctuations
- **Temperature**: 18-33Â°C with daily variations
- **Humidity**: 40-70% environmental readings
- **Light Intensity**: 200-1000 lux measurements
- **pH Levels**: 6.0-8.0 soil acidity tracking

##  Real-World Applications
